The ATIS-2025 Training Program on “Quantum Programming and Techniques for Information
Security” is an intensive, five-day immersion that equips IT graduates and early-stage
researchers with a rigorous foundation in quantum computation, secure quantum communication,
quantum machine learning (QML), and quantum federated learning (QFL). You will move from
core quantum information concepts to hands-on, security-oriented implementations using Qiskit
and related frameworks, culminating in a capstone mini-project that integrates cryptography and
learning.
